Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished. Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the result.

Many functions provided by browsers, especially the most interesting ones, can potentially take a long time, and therefore, are asynchronous. For example:

**Making HTTP requests using fetch()
**Accessing a user's camera or microphone using getUserMedia()
**Asking a user to select files using showOpenFilePicker()


Promises are the foundation of asynchronous programming in modern JavaScript. A promise is an object returned by an asynchronous
 function, which represents the current state of the operation. At the time the promise is returned to the caller, 
 the operation often isn't finished, but the promise object provides methods to handle the eventual success or failure of the 
 operation.

** A promise object is returned  to the caller function by an asynchronous function, which represents the current state of the
   operation. The operation often is not finished hence promise object provides method to handle(show) whether success or failure 
   of operations has happened.
